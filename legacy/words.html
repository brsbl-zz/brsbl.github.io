					2019
				</span>
				<span class="blog-date3">
					Dec. 31, 2018
				</span>
				<span class="blog-body3">
					It’s December 31st, 2018 so naturally it’s time to set some goals for 2019.
					<br>
					<br>
					In 2018, the main goals I set centered around art: finish writing a book of poetry, paint more watercolors, and make more music.
					<br>
					<br>
					Looking back, I did all of those things — down to the wire like the true procrastinator I am (I literally finished my book of poetry this morning), but completion is what matters.
					<br>
					<br>
					Now looking to 2019, I want to build on some of the goals I set this year and also make the goals a bit more concrete:
					<br>
					<h5> 1. Publish my book of poetry </h5>
					The first real job I wanted when I started thinking about careers in high school was to be an author. In fact, I almost majored in English in college. However, I don’t write as often as I used to or would like. I started to remedy this in October 2018 when I started to compile and edit a bunch of poetry I’d written over the course of many years into the start of a collection of poetry. As I began compiling the poems I’d already written, a narrative for the collection started to reveal itself and I wrote new poems to help tell this narrative. The entire process has been extremely rewarding and therapeutic and I want to round out the experience by finishing 2019 by saying I’m a published author.
					<br>
					<br>
					15 year old me will be so proud.
					<h5> 2. Read everyday </h5>
					Part of it may be my ADHD — particularly in the current era of short term, immediate gratification — part of it may be how time consuming reading long-form content may be — again particularly in the age of rampant short -form, scrolling content — and part of it may be just how busy I am, but I don’t read enough, and I need to fix this. The simplest way to do so would be to read part of a book everyday. That’s it. Pretty simple, but consistency is what I’m aiming for with this goal.
					<h5> 3. Read 10 books </h5>
					Building on the last goal, and making it a bit more concrete, I want to read at least 10 books in 2019, or a little less than a book a month. Part of the reason for this goal is the fact that I have become someone who is extremely good at buying new books (and even old classics) that seem interesting and then never reading them. As a result, I have a great, growing personal library of at least 50 books I haven’t read that I need to get through before I can let myself continue engaging in the consumerism I enjoy.
					<h5> 4. Release an EP </h5>
					I’ve been casually playing guitar since I was in high school, and recently began playing the keyboard and producing music by way of learning music theory. For a long time, I wanted to get more serious with my music, but hadn’t found the right catalyst until I created a Soundcloud account and started releasing the music I created over Thanksgiving break. Having a platform to release what I create is the kind of accountability I needed to really make progress (and this has proven true for all of my art so far). So in 2019, I want to take this a step further and not just release some music, but I want to also release a full EP — at least 4 tracks where I play at least 1 instrument and fully produce.
					<br>
					<br>
					It’ll probably be trash, but onwards.
					<h5> 5. Write a blog post a month </h5>
					This is building on my first goal. I haven’t written consistently in so long that it’s become harder to express my ideas quickly in written form, so much so that it’s a bit crippling. I get too much in my head with written content where I’ll write down a bunch of ideas and then come up with every and any excuse not to complete them, but really it’s mainly a fear of producing shitty content that doesn’t live up to the standards I have for myself. So, the only way to get past this is to just produce content, even if it’s shitty, so that at least that fear isn’t what’s holding me back.
					<br>
					<br>
					I have a few more things I’d like to do next year, but if I can get to December 31st, 2019 and have done all of the things on this list, the year will have been a success.

					Vince Staples, once again, delivers complex and incisive storytelling that both explores the paradoxal relationship between exuberance and nihilism in the face of mortality, and the fine line between cultural voyeurism and cultural exchange, all while making a project full of hits. Love this man. Listen to FM!

					What are you optimizing for?
				</span>
				<span class="blog-date">
					Nov. 04, 2018
				</span>
				<span class="blog-body">
					I was sitting around a dinner table in <a href="https://forthewomenretreat.com/">Mt. Tremblant, Quebec</a> with 10 other women discussing how our lives had turned out relative to what our expectations had been. After a certain point, one of the women turned to the group and asked “what are you all optimizing for?”
					<br>
					<br>
					Without much pause, I spoke up to say “learning.” I didn’t add much color at the time, but the more I think about it, the more I’m sure in my response.
					<br>
					<br>
					I've always been optimizing for some type of learning, and not least of all in my first job out of college when I worked in venture capital research, building investment portfolios of venture capitalists for endowments and foundations. I am extremely grateful for everything I learned at that job — it’s truly laid the foundation of what my career is today. However, I eventually left that job to work at venture-backed company because, ultimately, I grew frustrated of making decisions about what does or doesn’t make a good VC for our clients, while the VCs I was researching were, in turn, making decisions about what does or doesn’t make a good company, while all of us were so far removed from the day-to-month-to-years of compounded decisions that it takes to actually build a good company. So I left that job, in hopes of working at — and eventually learning what it takes to build — a good company. Though, it wasn’t until I read Ben Horowitz’s blog post,  <a href="https://a16z.com/2012/08/18/a-good-place-to-work">A Good Place to Work</a>, that I truly knew what it meant to be a good company.
					<br>
					<br>
					In finance and VC, a good company typically means a good investment, one that can bring outsized returns to its founders, shareholders, investors, etc., and that was the definition I had in my mind as well. Yet, Ben (a very successful entrepreneur and VC) presents quite a different definition after threatening to fire one of his executives (Steve) for failing to know one of Steve's managers had not met with any of his direct reports in the past six months.
					<br>
					<br>
					Ben says: "you might argue that no matter how well managed a company is, it will fail without product/market fit. You might argue further that horribly managed companies that achieve massive product/market fit succeed just fine. And you would be right on both accounts. So was it really necessary for me to make such a dramatic speech and threaten one of my executives?”
					<br><br>
					Yes, and there are 3 reasons why:
					<br>
					<ol>
						<li>Being a good company doesn’t matter when things go well, but it can be the difference between life and death when things go wrong.</li>
						<li>Things always go wrong.</li>
						<li>Being a good company is itself an end.</li>
					</ol>
					<br>
					As Ben says, <q>in good organizations, people can focus on their work and have confidence that if they get their work done, good things will happen for both the company and them personally. It is a true pleasure to work in an organization such as this. Every person can wake up knowing that the work they do will be efficient, effective and make a difference both for the organization and themselves. These things make their jobs both motivating and fulfilling.</q>
					<br>
					<br>
					Ben then goes on to describe his friend Bill Campbell, who had previously run a company called GO Corporation, which raised an exorbitant amount of venture capital in 1992 before essentially losing it all a couple of years later. While that may sound like a failure in some measure, what's remarkable is that of the tens of GO employees Ben has met in his career, everyone of them said GO was one of the greatest work experiences of their lives - despite the fact they didn't make any money and their careers plateued - because GO was a good place to work.
					<br>
					<br>
					And what is even more remarkable, I think, is that although Bill lost John Doerr (venture capitalist at <a href=“https://www.kleinerperkins.com/”>Kleiner Perkins</a>) a lot of money because of GO's failure, when Intuit needed a new CEO, John recommended Bill, because Bill knows how to build good companies.
					<br>
					<br>
					Now bringing it back to what I’m optimizing for: I'm seeking experiential learning such that I can continue to develop and improve my mental model of what it takes to build a good company. I’m not only seeking knowledge as it relates to my current job function — I love working in product as it is at the cross section of so many interesting aspects of a business, but ultimately I need a breadth of experiences in order to know how to build a good company. Building a company that people believe in, where they can feel inspired and fulfilled regardless of whether or not the company’s value is increasing is an amazingly interesting and important challenge.
					<br>
					<br>
					And if do nothing else, I want to build a good company.
