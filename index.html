	      I'm a product leader at <a href="https://www.mapbox.com">Mapbox</a>. Our software enables developers to build location and map-based applications. Mapbox has 1.6 million registered developers and over 650 million active users every month.
				<br>
				<br>
	      Prior to Mapbox, I worked in <a href="http://www.hallcapital.com/about/">Private Equity and Venture Capital research.</a> My team sourced and recommended investments across various private fund managers. Our clients were endowments, foundations, and high-net worth families.
	      <br>
				<br>
				At the same time, I started and ran a <a href="https://birthplacecoffee.co/">subscription-based coffee roastery.</a> We roasted ethically sourced Ethiopian coffee and donated 50% of profits to organizations that support coffee farmers, fund sustainable water infrastructure projects, and promote sustainable farming practices.
				<br>
				<br>
	      Before that, I studied Economics and French <a href="https://www.williams.edu/">in the mountains of western Massachusetts</a>.
